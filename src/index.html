        To keep the student-facing interface simple, I built out the client in pure JavaScript and allowed for mouse and keyboard movement of the game board.

        <div class="DescriptionSubheader">React | Redux | Rails | Semantic UI</div>
        To create the ratings in Yelp Disney, I utilized SVG Clip Paths, which allowed me to find and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=901851">report a bug in Google Chrome</a>.  The bug is now fixed, so the app will work well on both Firefox and newer versions of Chrome.

        For my first project in React, I decided to play with a drag and drop package called Draggable, and wrote up a pair of blog posts on how I persisted the position of dragged items within a scrolling div.
